Hotel Reservation Automation with n8n & Airtable
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to automate hotel room reservations using n8n.
A customer submits a reservation form, and the details are automatically stored in Airtable for easy management.

⚙️ Workflow Description

Form Submission Trigger

A reservation form is presented to the customer (name and room type).

When the form is submitted, the workflow starts automatically.

Airtable Integration

The submitted reservation data (Full Name, Room Choice) is sent directly to an Airtable base.

A new record is created for each reservation.

Automation Benefits

No manual data entry needed.

All reservations are centralized in Airtable.

Easily extendable (e.g., email confirmation, payment integration).
